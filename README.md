# ES1050-Final-Project
This program was developed for the Northern Tornadoes Project to scrape tweets from Twitter using filtering parameters set by the user. It can quickly scrape thousands of tweets and save the results in a .csv file, which will be included in a log file. Before running the program, create a directory named "Logs" in the program directory.

This program can be easily run using Python IDEs such as PyCharm, even for those who are new to Python. To clone the repository, you will need to install Git and the necessary dependency packages, which can be managed automatically through PyCharm. The program may have more dependencies than it needs, but this allows for flexibility in updating and expanding the program's capabilities.
